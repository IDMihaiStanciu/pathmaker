  - [x] Updated version to 0.1.0
  - [x] Added proper description, author, license (MIT)
  - [x] Added repository URL and keywords
  - [x] Added engine requirements (Node >=18.0.0, Yarn >=4.0.0)
  - [x] Added workspace scripts (build, dev, lint, type-check, clean)

- [x] **Step 2: Core Package.json - COMPLETED** ✅
  - [x] Added version, description, author, license
  - [x] Configured library entry points (main, module, types)
  - [x] Added build scripts (build, build:watch, dev, clean, type-check)
  - [x] Added dependencies (zustand for state management)
  - [x] Added dev dependencies (typescript, @types/node)
  - [x] Created tsconfig.json with proper ES2020 configuration
  - [x] Verified build system works (generates dist/ folder)

- [x] **Step 3: UI Package.json - COMPLETED** ✅
  - [x] Added version, description, author, license
  - [x] Configured React library entry points
  - [x] Added workspace dependency to @pathmaker/core
  - [x] Added React dependencies and type definitions
  - [x] Added peer dependencies (react, react-dom)
  - [x] Created tsconfig.json with JSX support
  - [x] Fixed TypeScript path mapping for workspace dependencies
  - [x] Created basic Pathmaker React component
  - [x] Verified build system works with React components

- [x] **Step 4: Example Package Configuration - COMPLETED** ✅
  - [x] Added type-check script to example/package.json
  - [x] Verified full integration testing works
  - [x] All packages now participate in monorepo scripts

### Session 3 (Today - June 27, 2025): TypeScript Configuration Refactoring - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **TypeScript Base Configuration - COMPLETED** ✅
  - [x] Created `tsconfig.base.json` with shared compiler options
  - [x] Refactored `packages/core/tsconfig.json` to extend base config
  - [x] Refactored `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` to extend base config  
  - [x] Refactored `example/tsconfig.app.json` to extend base config
  - [x] Refactored `example/tsconfig.node.json` to extend base config
  - [x] Reduced duplication and improved maintainability
  - [x] Verified all configs work with `yarn type-check`
  - [x] All packages (core, ui, example) pass type checking

## Foundation Setup - COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Project Infrastructure - COMPLETED
- [x] Git configuration (personal account)
- [x] Package.json cleanup and standardization
- [x] TypeScript configuration with shared base config
- [x] Build system setup working
- [x] Development environment ready

## Next Phase: Phase 2 - Core Logic (@pathmaker/core)

### Ready to Start: Type System
- [ ] Node and Edge type definitions
- [ ] Position and geometric types
- [ ] Workflow state types
- [ ] Event system types

### Then: State Management
- [ ] Zustand store setup
- [ ] Node operations (add, remove, update)
- [ ] Edge operations and validation
- [ ] Selection management

### Then: Utility Functions
- [ ] Geometric calculations
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Grid snapping
- [ ] Path finding algorithms

## Learning Notes

### Key Insights Gained
- React-Flow uses Zustand (same as n8n) ✅
- Visual node editors leverage CAD-like constraint systems ✅
- Separation of concerns critical for maintainability ✅
- **Monorepo workspace dependencies require careful TypeScript configuration** ✅
- **Build order matters: core must be built before ui can import it** ✅
- **TypeScript base configuration reduces duplication and improves maintainability** ✅

### Questions Resolved
- State management choice: Zustand over Redux ✅
- Architecture pattern: Core + UI packages ✅
- Learning approach: Step-by-step with review cycles ✅
- **TypeScript path mapping for workspace dependencies** ✅
- **MIT license selection for business-friendly open source** ✅
- **Shared TypeScript configuration best practices** ✅

### Questions Pending
- Build tool preference (Rollup vs Vite) for production builds
- Code quality tools setup (Biome vs ESLint+Prettier)
- Initial core type system design decisions

## Session Context for Continuation
When starting a new session, reference:
1. **COLLABORATION.md** - Working methodology
2. **LEARNING_PATH.md** - Overall plan and phases
3. **PROGRESS.md** - Current status and completed work
4. **REFERENCES.md** - Technical decisions and resources

**Current State**: Foundation phase complete. Ready to begin Phase 2 - Core Logic development with type system design.

## Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without explicit reasoning
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling
- Documentation for public APIs
- Workspace dependencies properly configured
- Shared TypeScript configuration maintained
